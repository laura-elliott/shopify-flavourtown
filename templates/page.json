The quality of what you put in TOTALLY dictates the finished product's taste. Where our competitors use cheaper, inferior<br/>ingredients, we prefer to go high and charge a fair price that reflects the artistry, small-batch baking and extremely high quality that goes into our products. </strong></p>"
